                              Container shipping is typically the most cost-effective and efficient method of ocean freight forwarding, but what if the goods you need to ship don’t fit in a standard shipping container? In this case, you may need to move your cargo using break bulk shipping.

                              Break bulk transportation involves moving large cargo in smaller units, such as pallets, barrels, drums, boxes, or bags. It was the most common method of ocean freight transportation before the rise of large container ships. While typically more labor intensive than full container load (FCL) and less than container load (LCL) shipping, it is often still the best shipping choice when products are too large, heavy, or awkwardly shaped to fit in a standard container, or if the products need to be transported to a minimally-developed port that can’t accommodate container ships.

                              If you have break bulk cargo, let Absa Group facilitate the move from beginning to end. With our years of experience and extensive professional network in the project cargo forwarding industry, we know how to transport your shipment safely and at the lowest possible cost to you.

                              Break bulk shipping is still used more frequently than you might think, especially in fields that need to move large or heavy goods, such as the petrochemical, oil and gas, energy, marine, and mining industries. Types of goods that are commonly transported in a

                              Break bulk requires more third party handling than containerized cargo, and if you’re shipping your goods this way, you need to make sure you’re working with a freight forwarding company you can rely on. We oversee the entire shipping process, from loading the cargo to delivering it directly to its final destination. We can also provide inland transportation using flat bed trucks or even barges. And no matter how complex your move, we’ll communicate with you throughout the transportation process so that you always know where your cargo is and how it’s being handled.

                              While this shipping method is known for being more expensive than container shipping services, we will work with our extensive network of freight forwarding professionals to negotiate the best prices available.
