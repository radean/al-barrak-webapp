                            Break bulk requires more third party handling than containerized cargo, and if you’re shipping your goods this way, you need to make sure you’re working with a freight forwarding company you can rely on. We oversee the entire shipping process, from loading the cargo to delivering it directly to its final destination.
<br><br>
                            We can also provide inland transportation using flat bed trucks or even barges. And no matter how complex your move, we’ll communicate with you throughout the transportation process so that you always know where your cargo is and how it’s being handled.
<br><br>
                            While this shipping method is known for being more expensive than container shipping services, we will work with our extensive network of freight forwarding professionals to negotiate the best prices available.
